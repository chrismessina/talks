Description

For the last century, humans have extended themselves beyond their corporeal form by mastering materials, productivity, and information. During that time, many of our advances were literally driven by the combustion engine, enabling humans to spread out and create a capillary system for distributing and redistributing resources and products. And now, as we find ourselves moving beyond the industrial revolution and into the fifth decade of the information revolution, not only is the pace of change speeding up, but our relationships with corporations, brands, and with each other are being reconfigured and rewritten.

A key enabler of this trend is the increasing ease of use of computers thanks to recent advances in artificial intelligence in the form of natural interfaces like voice. Consequently, the sheer quantity of people the world over joining the computer age is exploding. Humans are becoming more empowered and more productive, but just as likely, more confused and overwhelmed. Where the function of a brand was once to offer reassurance and establish trust, brands are increasingly experienced as extensions of ourselves. Computers have shrunk the distance (measured in time x effort) between a need rising to conscious awareness and our ability to seek its fulfillment. Those technology-enabled firms succeeding in this space, such as Amazon, are giving rise to anticipatory computing. But to effectively anticipate and meet your needs, these firms still need to be able to communicate with you, and that's why voice has become the next great competitive interface to master after touch. The voice interface may well be the last external computing interface before we directly link computers and our minds — with so-called neuralinks. This is why all the major tech players are racing to spawn their own godbots, available to serve you 24-7, 365 days a year, from anywhere you happen to be. Owning this interface will easily determine the winners for the next decade and beyond.

While it's still early days, these conversational agents point to a future in which each of us has a deeply personal and intimate relationship with our computing apparatus, and each of us is increasingly reliant on these intermediaries to filter the vastness of the web down to a subset of products, brands, and services that we, as humans, can comprehend and choice between at a moment's notice — if, that is, we care to choose at all.

Thus what's important for brands, companies, and marketers to realize in this moment is that what got you *here* will not get you *there*. Consumer expectations are rapidly evolving, and they will increasingly select for those experiences that mirror the subjective qualities of the digital interactions that they have with friends, family, and an emerging class of conversational digital agents. This is the world of conversational computing — where brands must become as ubiquitous, accessible, and individually knowledgeable about each and every one of their customers as those customers expect their friends and family to be for them. The implications are significant — especially for future generations who will grow up with a vastly different notion of what is “normal” and to be expected.

Chris Messina has spent over a decade living in Silicon Valley on the edge of social technology. He has designed products, platforms, and experiences for Google and Uber, founded startups, and changed the world by giving away many of his creations, including the hashtag. 

His skillset is broad, anchored in product and user experience design and human factors. Most recently, co-founded a conversational artificial intelligence startup that was incubated in Y Combinator's Winter '18 batch. Prior to that he he lead developer experience at Uber.

Chris has created movements online and off, and acted as catalyst for change in large and small organizations. In 2004, he helped organize the grassroots movement that propelled Mozilla Firefox to its first 100 million downloads. In 2005, he co-organized the first BarCamp and then popularized the unconference event model to over 350 cities around the world. In 2006, he opened the first coworking spaces in San Francisco, giving rise to a global movement. Then in 2007, he brought the idea of the hashtag to the world, changing social media forever and galvanizing social revolutions across the globe. He has spoken at conferences like SXSW, TEDx, Google |/0, and Microsoft's Future Decoded, and is frequently quoted in media outlets like The New York Times, Business Week, LA Times, Washington Post, and Wired.
